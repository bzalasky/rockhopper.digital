# Let's Build Your Product<span class="dot">.</span>

Hello, my name is Benjamin Zalasky. Do you have an idea for an app, yet
don't know how to build it on your own? Rockhopper Digital is a **digital
product consultancy** that solves problems like this with design and
technology.

Over the last eight years, I've helped my clients design, build and market
**software products** and **e-commerce businesses** with uncompromising
craftsmanship. Now, I'd like to teach you how to design and build a
product that provides value to paying customers.

## Write a story about a problem<span class="dot">.</span>

Why should anyone care about your product? Unless you’re able to tell a
story about how your product solves a problem that matters, it’s going
to be a hard sell. While this narrative is foundational, it shouldn’t
be unchangeable. This is how you’ll frame early conversations with
potential customers, and set the context for why your product matters.
But how do you tell an engaging story about a problem? Start with a
question.

Questions are one of the best tools for avoiding unwarranted
assumptions. Paul Graham suggests:

  > The initial idea is just a starting point–not a blueprint, but a
  > question.

A fresh perspective is invaluable when entering a domain that's ripe for
disruption. However, failure to recognize your own innate biases can
limit your ability to innovate. From your target market, to the problem
your product solves, don't limit yourself with assumptions unless you've
a compelling reason. There are times when assumptions are unavoidable,
but that's ok as long as you recognize them.

## Develop a product hypothesis<span class="dot">.</span>

## Gather insights from real people<span class="dot">.</span>

Idiosyncratic belief and passion are often at the heart of brilliance.
They are also barriers that can feed your own echo chamber. Don't fall
victim to this. External perspectives lend insight into the alignment
of your product in the marketplace, balancing raw, creative effort with
instructive guidance. However, time spent reflecting alone on your
discussions with others shouldn't be discounted.

## Iterate on rapid prototypes<span class="dot">.</span>

## Launch and learn<span class="dot">.</span>

Talk is cheap in all forms. This goes beyond just put up or shut up.
As Edward O. Wilson paraphrases Francis Bacon's idols of the
marketplace in <em>Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge</em>:
  
  > [Don't] let the power of mere words induce belief in non-existent
  > things.

Just as talking about your product won't get you to launch, someone
telling you a market exists doesn't mean it actually does. Take steps
to empirically validate any assumptions you've made about your product
and its place in the world.
