<h1>Let’s&nbsp;Build Your&nbsp;Product<span class="dot">.</span></h1>

Hello, my name is <a href="https://twitter.com/bzalasky">Benjamin Zalasky</a>.
Do you need help building your product? Rockhopper Digital is a digital product
consultancy that helps startups ship and market web software.

Great products deliver great outcomes. They’re consistently indispensable. To
get here, you need to understand the relationships between your potential
customers, the problem you're solving, the solution you're introducing, and your
ability to deliver that solution to market.

Over the last eight years, I’ve helped my clients design, build and market
software products and e-commerce businesses with uncompromising craftsmanship.
Now, I’d like to help you design and build your product.
