  Francis Bacon wrote about <span>idols of the mind</span>, with regard to
  scientific inquiry. With a nod to empiricism, here are four ways to build a
  product nobody wants.
</p>

<h2>Rely on preconceived assumptions</h2>

<p>Questions are one of the best tools for avoiding unwarranted assumptions.
Paul Graham suggests, &ldquo;<a href="http://paulgraham.com/ideas.html">The initial
idea</a> is just a starting point&ndash;not a
blueprint, but a question.&rdquo; A fresh perspective is invaluable when
entering a domain that&rsquo;s ripe for disruption. However, failure to recognize
your own innate biases can limit your ability to innovate. From your target
market, to the problem your product solves, don&rsquo;t limit yourself with
assumptions unless you&rsquo;ve a compelling reason. There are times when
assumptions are unavoidable, but that&rsquo;s ok as long as you recognize them.</p>

<h2>Fail to acknowledge external perspectives</h2>

<p>Idiosyncratic belief and passion are often at the heart of brilliance. They
are also barriers that can feed your own echo chamber. Don&rsquo;t fall victim to
this. External perspectives lend insight into the alignment of your product
in the marketplace, balancing raw, creative effort with instructive
guidance. Graham (in the same essay on ideas) suspects the
<em>together-alone-together sandwich</em> as being the most productive setup for
conceiving and implementing great ideas. I tend to agree with him. Time
spent reflecting alone on your discussions with others shouldn&rsquo;t be
discounted.</p>

<h2>Forget that talk is cheap</h2>

<p>Talk is cheap in all forms. This goes beyond just put up or shut up. Don&rsquo;t
&ldquo;let the power of mere words induce belief in non-existent
things,&rdquo; as Edward O. Wilson paraphrases Bacon&rsquo;s <em>idols of the
marketplace</em> in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/067976867X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=067976867X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rockhodigita-20">Consilience: The Unity of
Knowledge</a>
(unashamed to drop an affiliate link here). Just as talking about your
product won&rsquo;t get you to launch, someone telling you a market exists doesn&rsquo;t
mean it actually does. Take steps to empirically validate any assumptions
you&rsquo;ve made about your product and its place in the world.</p>

<h2>Let dogmatic thinking cloud your vision</h2>
    

<p>Unquestioning acceptance is almost never a good thing for product
development. An open mind allows you to see opportunities that would be
missed if you closed off your thinking. Dogmatic thinking begets more of the
same old thing. The product might not be terrible, but you&rsquo;re running the
risk of developing the kind of uninspiring software that needs to be sold
with <a href="http://vimeo.com/2723800">fancy steak dinners and extravagant bar
tabs</a>. Shake up the enterprise and don&rsquo;t box
yourself in!</p>

<h2>In Summary</h2>

<p>Start with a question. See the world as it is. Make something better.</p>
