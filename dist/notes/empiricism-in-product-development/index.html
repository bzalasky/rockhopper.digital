  Francis Bacon wrote about idols of the mind, with regard to scientific
  inquiry. With a nod to empiricism, here are four ways to build a product
  nobody wants.
</p>

<h2>Rely on preconceived assumptions</h2>

<p>Questions are one of the best tools for avoiding unwarranted assumptions. Paul
Graham suggests, &ldquo;the initial idea is just <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ideas.html">a starting
point</a>&mdash;not a blueprint, but a
question.&rdquo; A fresh perspective is invaluable when entering a domain that&rsquo;s
ripe for disruption.</p>

<p>However, failure to recognize your own innate biases can limit your ability to
innovate. From your target market, to the problem your product solves, don&rsquo;t
limit yourself with assumptions unless you&rsquo;ve a compelling reason. There are
times when assumptions are unavoidable, but that&rsquo;s ok as long as you recognize
 them.</p>

<h2>Fail to acknowledge external perspectives</h2>

<p>Idiosyncratic belief and passion are often at the heart of brilliance. They are
also barriers that can feed your own echo chamber. Don&rsquo;t fall victim to this.
External perspectives lend insight into the alignment of your product in the
marketplace, balancing raw, creative effort with instructive guidance.</p>

<p>In the same essay on ideas, Graham suspects the <em>together-alone-together
sandwich</em> as being the most productive setup for conceiving and implementing
great ideas. I tend to agree with him. Time spent alone reflecting on
discussions with others shouldn&rsquo;t be discounted.</p>

<h2>Let yourself be seduced by words</h2>

<p>As Edward O. Wilson paraphrases Bacon&rsquo;s <em>idols of the marketplace</em> in
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55981.Consilience">Consilience: The Unity of
Knowledge</a>, don&rsquo;t
&ldquo;let the power of mere words induce belief in non-existent things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Talking about your product won&rsquo;t get you to launch. Someone telling you a market
exists doesn&rsquo;t mean it actually does. Take steps to empirically validate any
assumptions you&rsquo;ve made about your product and its place in the world.</p>

<h2>Cloud your vision with dogmatic thinking </h2>
    

<p>Unquestioning acceptance is almost never a good thing for product development.
An open mind allows you to see opportunities that would be missed if you closed
off your thinking. Dogmatic thinking begets more of the same old thing, or
worse, something nobody wants.</p>

<h2>In Summary</h2>

<p>Start with a question. See the world as it is. <strong>Make something better.</strong></p>
